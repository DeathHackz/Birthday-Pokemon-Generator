# About

This is just a simple website to find your special pok&eacute;mon.

This started out as a project for a coding program, but soon turned into a really awesome time-killer. This website
is my ~~first~~ second real attempt at making a website with fully functioning features. This current website was rewritten
from the ground up, as an attempt to improve the original, which can be found [here](https://github.com/DeathHackz/Random-Pokemon-Generator). Hopefully you enjoy using my site, and share it with others.

This is still not professionally made
by no means, its just a stepping stone in hopes to improve myself, and my skills.
